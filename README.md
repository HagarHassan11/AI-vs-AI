## **Introduction**
> The project tackles the challenge of differentiating between real and AI-generated images. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we developed an AI system that detects synthetic images generated by various models, including GANs, Diffusion-based models, and others.

## **Dataset**
> The dataset includes over 2 million real and AI-generated images, sourced from 25 different generators (13 GANs, 7 Diffusion models, and 5 other miscellaneous sources). This diversity ensures that the model generalizes well across different image-generation methods
