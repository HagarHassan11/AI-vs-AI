## **Introduction**
The project tackles the challenge of differentiating between real and AI-generated images. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we developed an AI system that detects synthetic images generated by various models, including GANs, Diffusion-based models, and others.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes over 2 million real and AI-generated images, sourced from 25 different generators (13 GANs, 7 Diffusion models, and 5 other miscellaneous sources). Additionally, the real images were collected from 8 diverse sources, as shown in the figure.
> This diversity ensures that the model generalizes well across different image-generation methods and performs robustly in detecting AI-generated images from both known and unseen generators.

## **Model Architecture**
Our model incorporates a Capsule Network with feature extraction using parts of the VGG19 architecture. The Capsule Network is selected for its superior performance in preserving spatial hierarchies and providing robust detection capabilities.

Key Features:
- VGG19 for Feature Extraction: Captures important visual features from the images.
- Capsule Network: Enhances the model's ability to detect fake images by preserving spatial relationships between features.
